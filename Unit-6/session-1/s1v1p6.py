# Skip the first node (head) â€” it's not considered a critical point.
# Use a three-pointer traversal:
# prev: the previous node,
# curr: the current node (potential critical point),
# next: the node after curr.
# Traverse the list from the second node to the second-to-last node (ignoring head and tail).
# At each step:
# Check if curr is a local minima:
# prev.val > curr.val < next.val
# Check if curr is a local maxima:
# prev.val < curr.val > next.val
# If either condition is true, increment a counter for critical points.
# Continue moving all three pointers forward until next is None (i.e., curr is the second-to-last node).
